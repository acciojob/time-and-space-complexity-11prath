  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the computational time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to improve performance and scalability.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input.
